# RTPackConverter
A tool to convert RTPack Assets (Proton SDK) into standard images.

This tool allows you to convert multiple rtfont and rttex files from Tanked, Dink Smallwood, Growtopia, etc into images under seconds.

Now with .NET8 support, tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu. OSX Release should work, but I have no way of testing it myself...

# Downloading
Download in the "Releases" tab.

## NOTE:
The automatic releases are currently configured to publish self-contained files, that means you won't need to install .NET8 or any other dependencies, they should all run out of the box. If you are somehow bothered by the "big" file size, either build it yourself or pester me to add framework dependent releases to the workflow.

# How to use
Drag a directory or files on it, and it will convert for you.
